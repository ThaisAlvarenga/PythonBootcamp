# 100 Python Scripts

Repo for my self-imposed challenge of writing 100 python scripts. I'm taking this as an opportunity to practice more with Python and expand my skillsets with it. 

Peronal Note: 
I give thanks to professor Sanah Odeh, who first taught me Python and how to apply it for practical everyday solutions.
